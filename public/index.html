        <h4>An AR app to help potential pet owners find the right pet to adopt</h4>
      </div>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/mockup/Furever.png" src="" alt="">
      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        “Furever Pal” was a project developed in the course of User-Centered Design at University of Washington. The app allows users to find a adoptable pet they like, see how it would look in their homes and fit their lifestyles. It features AR (augmented reality) experience and Tinder-inspired swiping interaction to streamline the decision making process for users to choose the right pet.
      </p>
      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2017/09 - 2017/12
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        User Research<br>
        Usability Testing<br>
        UX Design Iteration<br>
      </p>
      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <h4>Problem Space</h4>
      <p>        
        Only 1 out of 10 animals in shelters is adopted while 2.7 million dogs and cats are put to sleep each year. Our project aim to improve communication between animal shelters and potential pet owners. However, we discovered that the scope of our goal was too broad and general, therefore we narrowed our scope to focus on the adoption process.
      </p>
      <h4>Original Design Question</h4>
      <p>
        "How might we help improve communication between animal shelters and potential pet owners, so that the adoption process goes more smoothly?"
      </p>
      <h4>Research Methods</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          Survey: We designed a survey targeting current and potential pet owners and received 90 responses in a week
        </span>
        <span>
          Interview: We conducted interviews with three local animal shelters: Regional Animal Services of King County (RASKC), Emerald Pet City Rescue, and PAWS
        </span>
        <span>
          Contextual Inquiry: We conducted contextual inquiry at a pet adoption event hosted by Ginger’s Pet Rescue
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-1.png" src="" alt="">
      <br>
      <h4>Research Findings</h4>
      <p>
        From the interviews:
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-2.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        From the survey results:
        <span>
          86.7% of pet owners who have adopted a pet found that the adoption process to be open and easy
        </span>
        <span>
          81% of current pet owners felt that finding and choosing the right pet that fit their lifestyle were the most difficult part of the adoption process
        </span>
        <span>
          Current pet owners thought the interaction with the pet was important in the adoption process
        </span>
        <span>
          Detailed descriptions, pictures and videos of the pets are the most important adoption information
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-3.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        Based on our research findings, we found that the adoption process is already easy and smooth here in Seattle; however, we were intrigued that many people found the decision making process to be the most difficult part of the entire adoption process. We decided to refine our design question to focus on that specific aspect, which is choosing the right pet. 
      </p>
      <h4>Refined Design Question</h4>
      <p>
        How might we help improve communication between animal shelters and potential pet owners, so that the decision making part of the adoption process is easier?
      </p>
      <h3>PERSONA</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Primary Users: Potential pet adopters</b>
        We hope to introduce a solution for potential pet owners to discover and connect with pets that are best suited for their requirements and conditions.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-4.png" src="" alt="">
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>Secondary Users: Staffs, fosters, and volunteers of animal shelters</b>
          These people will use our solution to manage and maintain useful information of pets in their shelters. These pieces of information are necessary to help adopters choose the right pet.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-5.png" src="" alt="">

      <h3>IDEATION</h3>
      <p>
        Our team conducted an ideation session and sketched 20+ ideas to meet our users’ needs based on our research findings. 
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-6.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        Keeping the primary use case “finding the right pet” in mind, we critique and filter the sketches, then decided to combine two of the most promising ideas - Tinder-inspired pet finding app with augmented reality (AR) to streamline the decision process - to create our design solution prototype.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-7.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        Our design solution “Furever Pal” is an easy-to-use and intuitive app for users to efficiently find a pet they like and see how that pet would look in their homes and fit their lifestyles. 
      </p>
      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        Our designer chose to use warm colors and Sans serif fonts to create a light, refreshing and engaging app design. The app also provides an effortless, intuitive and smooth user experience.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-8.png" src="" alt="">
      <h4>Constraints</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          It is hard to present immersive AR experience in the mockup and the prototype
        </span>
        <span>
          Low-fidelity prototypes or paper prototypes cannot highlight the efficiency of the swiping mechanism
        </span>
        <br>
        Our team decided to build a high-fidelity mockup for prototyping to give users the best sense of the AR feature and swiping mechanism.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-9.png" src="" alt="">
      <h3>PROTOTYPE</h3>
      <p>The clickable prototype was created with Origami. Our team also come up with a creative way to showcase the AR pet viewer feature.</p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-10.png" src="" alt="">
        <div class="youtube-box-main">
          <div class="youtube-box-main-169">
            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/254652083" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div> 
        </div> 
      <h4>How Our Prototype Supports The Design Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        We derived design requirements from our research findings: intuitive design that improves pet discoverability, help people find a suitable pet, provide an immersive experience, and help make the decision process easier. Users will be able to use our design mockup to complete the following use cases:<br>
        1. Find a pet by swiping left or right<br>
        2. Use AR to get a better sense of the pet<br>
        3. Reserve a meet & greet with the pet<br>
      </p>
      <h3>USABILITY TESTING</h3>
      <p>
        We conducted 5 usability testings and get feedbacks from on our key questions to improve our design solution. The folowing are the findings:
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-11.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
         <span>
           4/5 users thought our app makes finding an adoptable pet more efficient and make discoverability better
         </span>
         <span>
           4/5 users thought the survey questions helped choose and filter the most suitable pets
         </span>
         <span>
           4/5 users accidentally swiped left on a pet and wished they could go back and learn more about the pet before deciding to pass or like
         </span>
         <span>
           All 5 users liked the AR feature, however the term is not universally recognized
         </span>
      </p>
      <h3>ITERATION</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
        Improved the instruction overlay: simplified the text and updated the symbols
        </span>
        <span>
          “Go Back” functionality: add a button to allow users to go back to a pet they may have accidentally swiped left on  
        </span>
        <span>
          Rebranded AR Feature: change the text of the AR button for users to understand what this function does
        </span>
        <span>
          Confirmation Pop-Up: provide name of animal shelter in addition to the date and time of the appointment
        </span>
        <span>
          Enhanced pet information with multimedia content: add carousel design to allow users to discover more pictures and videos
        </span>
        <span>
          Survey design: add more choices to pet activity level
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>FUTURE DIRECTION</h3>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Furever-12.png" src="" alt="">
      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
        As the first project in the HCDE master program, we went through a full research process during this project. We am are lucky to have have a cross-functional team consists with a clear division of work, and we gained different field knowledge and feedbacks from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned how to scope down our ideas into a complete solution since we started our project with huge ambitions and too broad of a goal. We could have a more specific focus for a more accurate research direction. Also, we would like to recruit real target users for usability testings to validate our design.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        “BookeMe” is a award-winning project created in cooperation with three developers and a designer in the 2017 Booking.com Taipai hackathon.<br>
        <br>
        “BookMe” aims to simplify the decision making process by providing personalized travel recommendations with the best offers on Booking.com. The app applies image recognition technique to the content users interacted with on Instagram, and analyzes their preference to recommend travel spots accurately.
      </p>
      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2017/03
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        User Research<br>
        Interaction Design<br>
        Project Management<br>
      </p>
      <h3>CONSTRAINTS</h3>
      <p>
          Within only 48 hours, our goal was to focus on solving the problem by delivering a functional working product by the end of the hackathon. So one of the biggest constraints we had to work with was lack of time. We had to make decisions quickly, skip through wireframes, and jump from sketches to designing Hi-Fi prototypes and prototype iteration.
      </p>

      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <h4>User Journey</h4>
      <p> 
        We aimed to understand the online travel booking experience within 3 hours, starting from users’ first step of decision making. At the beginning, We created a user journey map of a travel shopper to help us visualize the areas we needed to target for our research. 
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Bookme-1.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        Then, we conducted 5 interviews with people who have booked a trip online. Below are the main findings:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Users want to determine where they should go efficiently when they are planning a trip
        </span>
        <span>
          Users want more personalized travel suggestions based on their preference instead of recommendations based on travel history on their Booking.com homepage
        </span>
        <span>
          Users tend to make travel decisions according to interaction on social network and friends’ suggestion
        </span>
        <span>
          Users want to get notified when the best offers appears of their desirable travel spots
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p> 
        After analyzing and organizing all the information, the detailed user stories were formulated. The following are the main requirements of the app in the user stories: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Users can log in with their social media account in the product
        </span>
        <span>
          Users can get personalized travel suggestions based on a more precise preference setting instead of existing filters
        </span>
        <span>
          Users’s interaction with their friends on social media can help them make travel decisions easier
        </span>
        <span>
          Users can get notified when the best offers appears of their desirable travel spots
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to build an app “Bookme” to reverse the way users used to plan a trip, provide more personalized recommendations based on analyzing user preference.
      </p>
      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
      <p>
        According to our users stories, we first made the flowchart and then the wireframes to communicate the flow and the key features of the app.
      </p>
      <h4>Visual Design</h4>
      <p>
        The design intends to create a delightful feeling for travel shoppers to experience the new flow of planning a trip. The interaction should be smooth and effortless because it's suppose to lubricate the current decision making process.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Bookme-2.png" src="" alt="">
      <h4>Development</h4>
      <p>
        We decided to apply image recognition techniques to the picture content users interacted with and analyze them with Google Vision API. The comprehensive results can analyze users’ preference more accurately and predictively for recommendations, and can optimize through machine learning.
      </p>
      
      <h3>PROTOTYPE</h3>
      <p>
        The engineers hand-coded a digital prototype in 5 hours to showcase our ideas and communicate the transition and interaction in the app.

      <h3>FUTURE DIRECTION</h3>
      <p>
      Our team are positive about more business development about “Bookme”:
      <span>
        For B2C : we want to link more current users and invite potential users from Boking.com
      </span>
      <span>
        For B2B:  the recommendation results and user preference data can help related travel industries to understand user needs and create more accurate ads
      </span>
      </p>
      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
        The engineers and product managers from Booking.com found our idea and prototype to be highly valuable. We received comments that this application addressed a well-known problem and applied image recognition techniques appropriately, even from business perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hackathon was a challenging and insightful two-day training. I have gained hands-on experience about the collaboration process of development within a limited time, and how to make rapid progress in a small team.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        First launch in 2014, Backme is a payment application developed by Backer-Founder. Users can easily embed its customized APIs to launch a crowdfunding campaign or an e-commerce website without the limitation of a crowdfunding platform. Backme has assisted over 700 projects to go online, with a total cash flow of $100 million USD and 300,000+ transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the product manager, I conducted user research and usability testings to propose usability insights and new feature recommendations. I coordinated with UI designers and developers to redesign the admin panel and optimize the checkout process, eventually increased conversion by 28% and reduced bounce rate by 35% in a month.

      </p>
      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2016/02-2017-08      
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        Product Strategy<br>
        Information Architecture<br>
        Interaction Design<br>
        Conversion Optimization<br>
      </p>
      <h3>PROJECT IMPACT</h3>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-0.png" src="" alt="">

      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted 10+ interviews and contextual inquiries in a year with three types of users: clients & end users (external), project managers and developers / designers (internal). Contextual inquiries complement the interview answers, and helped me define users’ need when I observe their behavior using Backme.
      </p>
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          For clients, they want a clear visual hierarchy to help them find necessary informations to deal with customer service on the admin panel
        </span>
        <span>
          For end users, the checkout process should be easy to understand, simple and estimable.
        </span>
        <span>
          For project managers, they want to have access to real-time sales data from different sources (ideally visualized), so that they can calculate conversion rate to adjust marketing strategies
        </span>
        <span>
          For developers and designers, the application lacks a systematic design guideline, which makes it hard to develop and iterate efficiently
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Define Problems</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          The app needs a design guideline so designers and developers can implement new designs efficiently with a clear principle
        </span>
        <span>
          Clients can hardly find necessary project information because the navigation and visual hierarchy lack simplicity and clarity. Furthermore, the search bar was nor presented unless they scroll to the right
        </span>
         <span>
          Project managers point out that the high bounce rate (83%) at the check out page should be optimized
        </span>
        <span>
          Project managers want to see the real-time conversion data in a clear form like other analytical tools, so they can adjust marketing strategies more efficiently
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>REDESIGN PROCESS</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the users stories, I prioritized the tasks and created wireframes with the designer together to communicate the features. As the product manager, I invited all the stakeholders to monthly meetings to reach agreement on key features and the design decision.
      <h3>UI DESIGN GUIDELINE</h3>
      <p>
        To build the brand identity and provided a clear principle for the product team to develop upcoming new features, the designer expanded the design guideline with more UI components. The updated design guidelines provide helpful advice on how to achieve a platform-specific design principle for Backme.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-7.png" src="" alt="">
      </p>
      <h3>Task 1: Redesign Project Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        We redesigned the project dashboard to refine the navigation and visual hierarchy of the original project dashboard and provide project information more efficiently.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-1.png" src="" alt="">

      <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
      <p>
       We held a meeting with all the stakeholders involved to reorganized the information architecture of the Project Dashboard to ensure users can easily discover all the necessary project information they need.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-2.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
      We also added tags and labels as part of the project information, so project managers can categorized information from mutual projects. We carefully regulate the operating behavior of each card, eliminating distracting elements so that the users can easily find the key gadgets.
      </p>

      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>
        After clarifying the key features, I created wireframes to conceptualize the ideas and communicate with stakeholders and developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        we decided to design two versions that users can switch between:
        <br>
      <span>
        Grid view: implements card style design with a more responsive display for different screen sizes
      </span>
      <span>
        List view: displays more projects in a limited space
      </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-3-1.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
       Also, I present wireframes meetings with project managers and clients to ensure the prioritization of content and the structure meet their needs.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-3-2.png" src="" alt="">
      <br>
      <h4>Hi-Fidelity Prototype</h4>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-4.png" src="" alt="">

      <h3>Task 2: Optimize the Checkout Process</h3>
      <p>
       As an embedded online payment tool, the user goals of our product are:<br>
       <br>
      <span>
        For clients, they want to ensure the conversion rate at checkout - the last step of the online shopping process
      </span>
      <span>
        For end users (customers), they want to buy products online with a easy to understand, simple, and secure checkout experience
      </span>
      </p>
      <p>
      Before optimizing, Backme has a 83% bounce rate in the check out process. We redesigned several key points to optimize users’ payment experience as simple and intuitive as possible. One month after the design is implemented, we successfully increased conversion rates by 28% and reduced bounce rate by 35% in a month.
      </p>

      <h4>Chunking Checkout Steps</h4>
      <p>
       We improved the design by chunking the checkout process into 3 steps so users feel simple and easy. The 3 step design is suggested by a payment study conducted by Shopify. By grouping relevant information together in chunks, and putting it in a logical order, Backme allows users to focus on one task at a time.<br>
      <br>
       Checkout Flow: Confirm Order → Fill Out Shipping Information → Choose Payment Method
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Step 1 － Confirm Order
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-6.1.png" src="" alt="">
        <span>
          Step 2 － Fill Out Shipping Information
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-6.2.png" src="" alt="">
        <span>
          Step 3 － Choose Payment Method
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-6.3.png" src="" alt="">
      </p>

      <h4>Optimize Web Form Filling Experience for Step 2</h4>
      <p>
       Users need to fill out shipping information at Step 2 of the checkout process. Filling the form is considered the final step to complete checkout, therefore our goal is to enable users to complete forms quickly and without confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The followings are some tips of redesigning our web form filling experience:<br>
        <br> 
      <span>
        Only ask for required information because every extra field will affect its conversion rate
      </span>
      <span>
        Order the form logically from the user’s perspective, and group related fields together
      </span>
      <span>
        Use drop down menu for a list of options (e.g. Country Lists)
      </span>
      <span>
        Provide visual feedback on correct information and adaptive error message when users enter information incorrectly
      </span>
      </p>

      <h3>Task 3: Redesign the Data Analysis Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
       One of the important tasks for project managers is to keep track of Google UTM parameters code and conversion rate to optimize marketing strategies. Therefore, our goal is to redesign the data display on the Data Analysis Dashboard, which helps project managers evaluate real-time conversion rate efficiently. 
      </p>
      <p>
       We decided to visualize the main indicators of user behaviors for the “Marketing Campaign Analysis” chart.<br>
       <br>
       <span>
         Use spline chart to display the traffic from different marketing campaign sources
       </span>
       <span>
         Use bar chart to present the CTR (Click-through rate) rankings of individual marketing campaign
       </span>
       <span>
         Create an intuitive UI which can also display real-time data responsively when users hover
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       We also created the new feature of “ROI calculator” (Return On Investment) by importing Google Analytics tracking data and calculate on Backme. Users can input the cost for each advertising campaign to calculate the conversion rate automatically.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Backme-5.png" src="" alt="">

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
       I have participated in the product development on both stakeholder’s side - as the product manager and the user (project manager) - for almost two years. We ran sprints internally with different beta version then released for our clients in the crowdfunding and e-commerce industry. We used these feedbacks to identify key functionalities, prioritize tasks and keep refining the design for better user experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have gained practical experience on how to make rapid progress in a cross-functional team, and keep iterating the product design and strategy through repetitive testing, user data and customer validation.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        Ticwatch 2 is a interactive smartwatch backed by 10,000 backers on Kickstarter. Its update version, Ticwatch S & E is powered by Android Wear™ and has raised over 3 million USD on Kickstarter with 19,251 backers, ranked as the 2nd best smartwatch product (after Pebble). <br>
      <br>
        My team at Backer-Founder was responsible for the Ticwatch Taiwan pre-order campaign. We analyzed user insights through research to develop holistic marketing and design strategies, and pushed the sales number over 1 million USD. It is ranked as the most funded crowdfunding/pre-order project in Taiwan in 2017.  
      </p>
      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2016/12 - 2017/08  
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        Project Manager<br>
      </p>
      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>
        At the beginning, our client provided us the survey results about users’ profile and buying behavior in US and China market. We discovered that users in different countries tend to have distinct preferences on features and style in terms of wearable products. Therefore, we decided to conduct a quantitive research to clarify the user profile in Taiwan market.
      </p>
      <h4>Survey</h4>
      <p>        
        We designed three types of surveys by targeting three different potential user groups with Facebook ads: <br>
        <br>
        1. Users who are interested in wearable devices<br>
        2. Users who are familiar with other smartwatch brands<br>
        3. Tech-savvy users and early adopters<br>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-1.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        We want to make sure that users will be provided with specifically customized content in tune with their respective interests and expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than 6,000+ survey responses (including e-mail lists) were collected within a month, which helped us identify the most compelling features and buying incentives to our target users, define a clearer potential user profile, and further scope the design focus of our website and advertising.
      </p>
      <h3>CAMPAIGN MATERIAL DESIGN</h3>
      <h4>Commercial Photography</h4>
      <p>
        Product images are a powerful way to capture the user’s attention and to differentiate a product. Besides the photos provided by our client, we re-photographed commercial photos for Ticwatch focusing on the product itself and the most commonly used functions catering to user’s needs from our research.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I communicated with the designer to ensure our product imagery allow users to experience the product on a digital website:
        <span>
          Contextualize the product images: put the product into context to help users clarify exactly what the product is, how it is used, and who is likely to use it
        </span>
        <span>
          Find the perfect zoom with multiple angles: make use of the zoom functionality so that users can better visualize product details and features
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Promotion Video</h4>
      <p>
        We edited the original video into a short version with transcript and animation to mark the product highlights, and help user understand what Ticwatch does in everyday life. We also produced an testing video so users can get a better sense of the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two promotion video reached 345,000 and 410,000 views respectively on Facebook, and successfully turn into conversion for 25% of total sales.
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-2.png" src="" alt="">
      </p>
      <h3>WEBSITE DESIGN</h3>
      <p>Ticwatch Pre-order Website: <a href="www.ticwatch2.com.tw" target="_blank">www.ticwatch2.com.tw</p>
      <p>
        To build the pre-order website with localized design and customized content based on our user research, we discard copying the style from the global website and Kickstarter page. However, we still implement consistent branding across all channels so that users recognize the brand and the product.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-4.png" src="" alt="">
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-5.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        I coordinated with designers and developers to create a engaging digital experience for the website. It also has a responsive design that adapts to look perfect on all of the different devices.
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-6.png" src="" alt="">
      </p>
      <h4>Information Architecture & Content Strategy</h4>
      <p>
        We aim to design a website with a clear information architecture and hierarchy which allow users to discover the information they expect easily. We come up with the main sections of the website:<br>
        1. List the achievements on Kickstarter and media quotes for brand awareness and enhance users’ confidence toward crowdfunding products<br>
        2. Demonstrate product highlights with interactive design<br>
        3. Contextualize the product, allowing users to understand the features they care about<br>
        4. Provide product specification to ensure users have all the detailed information before purchase<br>
        5. Improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization) with accurate keywords in HTML meta tags to affect the online visibility of our website<br>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-7.png" src="" alt="">
      <h4>Animation</h4>
      <p>
        We incorporate animation as a functional element to enhance user experience.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Tic-int2.gif" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        To create an intuitive, user-friendly checkout process, we also provide visual feedback on user action in the shopping cart to inform users about the result of their operation. 
      </p>

          </div> 
        </div> 

      <h3>CAMPAIGN PROMOTION</h3>
      <h4>Email Marketing</h4>
      <p>
        Before launching the pre-order campaign, we sent 3 e-mail newsletters to potentials users to reveal the product information, and increase engagement by providing exclusive offers.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-9.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        The average email open rate reached over 45% with over 5,700 recipients (average email open rate in the e-commerce industry of technology products: 5-10%), proved that we provided engaging content and targeted the accurate potential users.
      </p>
      <p>
      We applied several UX design tips that impact directly on email marketing conversions:<br>
      <span>
        Responsive design: a well-developed design makes the emails readable on any screen
      </span>
      <span>
        Use logos and company own domain: it helps users recognize our brand
      </span>
      <span>
        Objective, relevant and personalized subject line
      </span>
      <span>
        Catchy header to transmit the message at the first glance
      </span>
      <span>
        Bullet points that turn the text into concise content
      </span>
      <span>
        Clearly marked and well placed Call-to-Actions
      </span>
      <span>
        Sharing the content in social networks to engage
      </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-10.png" src="" alt="">
      <h4>Media Promotion</h4>
      <p>
        We were clear that the target users for press release are the editors and journalists. Therefore, our goal was to provide appealing media kits with catchy titles, exclusive images and press value to catch their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created the press release material with 3 major topics as listed below. As a result, Ticwatch was successfully featured on 20 mainstream medias, including 
        <a href="https://goo.gl/KTFKuE" target="_blank">Yahoo! 3C</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/qRyLjq" target="_blank">Apple Daily</a> (the largest digital media in Taiwan).<br>
        <br>
        <span>
          Phenomenal crowdfunding record: Raised over 3 million USD, Ticwatch ranks as the second-best smartwatch on Kickstarter
        </span>
        <span>
          The most compatible cross-platform smartwatch at an extremely affordable price ever- Ticwatch
        </span>
        <span>
          Google-backed Ticwatch to take on Apple watch, now debut in Taiwan
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Press Conference</h4>
      <p>
        We held a press conference on the first day of the Ticwatch pre-order campaign. We invited over 50 media editors and key opinion leaders in the technology field to experience the product debut. They also spread the words on social network to increase media exposure and convince consumers of product quality.
      </p>
      <h4>Social Media Engagement</h4>
      <p>
        Since our research findings showed that about 28% of our target users are still skeptical towards crowdfunding products (especially high-end technology products), we believed that reliable user reviews and opinion leadership played a informally influential role in consumers’ attitude and purchase decision. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We invited the top 15 domestic technology key opinion leaders to try out Ticwatch, then share their professional experience and product details on Facebook, blogs and forums.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-12.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        As a result, 20% of the sales number was brought in by these reviews on social media (70% was from advertising, 10% from media reports, and the rest from native searches), representing that reliable user reviews are trust-worthy for users to make their buying decision.
      </p>
      <h4>Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        Over 80% of our website traffic was driven by Facebook ang Google ads. 5% amount of the total sales numbers were spent on advertising, and the ad conversions was accounted for 70% of the total sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        We continued to monitor real-time ad performance since the data directly reflects users’ preferences and behaviors. We conducted A/B testing with different product images and ad copywriting for the same set of audiences to evaluate the best-performing ad and our communication strategy. 
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Ticwatch-13.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        The conversion rate is the main performance indicator our client cared about. On the first week of the pre-order campaign, the ad conversion rate reached an amazing 1: 130; the data remained steadily at 1:20 or even higher two months later, proving that we were effectively tailoring to the accurate audience segments, providing engaging content and website design.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        Animal Savior is a <a href="https://red-dot.de/pd/online-exhibition/work/?lang=en&code=16-01578-2017&y=2017&c=227&a=0" target="_blank">2017 Red Dot Award</a> winner in Product Design, and also the first ever crowdfunding project of sex toy in Taiwan. It is known for its groundbreaking animal outlines, delicate texture as well as intuitive control. My team at Backer-Founder assisted with the overall marketing strategies and campaign page design, achieving the funding target of $80,000 USD with 1,546 supporters in 45 days, which was 350% of the expected target. 
      </p>
      <h3>STRATEGY PLANNING</h3>
      <p>
        Male consumers accounted for more than 70% of the sex toy market in Taiwan. However, the characteristics of “Animal Savior” gave a sense of cuteness, safety, trustworthiness as well as real affordability, which allowed us to set its target users as females who were buying sex toys for the first time. 
      </p> 
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Animal.png" src="" alt="">
      <p> 
        This strategy was applied to our copywriting, website design, video and other promotional materials in order to create a consistency brand identity and connect with first-time female buyers.
      </p>
      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>
        We decided to conduct pretotyping to validate our product strategy and collect feedbacks from female consumers when facing such sensitive product. 
      </p>
      <h4>Survey</h4>
      <p>
        We designed the survey as a psychological test about “Which Cute Animal Fits You The Best?” to introduce the five product characters to potential users. The survey result will pair the user’s personality with one of the animals, hoping to arouse their interest and break the stereotype of sex toys.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Animal-2.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        More than 2,500+ survey responses (including e-mail lists) were collected within three weeks, which helped us identify the most popular product feature to our target users, define a clearer demographic profile, and further validate the design and copywriting style of the entire campaign.
      </p>
      <h4>Research Findings</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          73% of our survey respondents have’t purchased sex toys before. The first-time buying incentive will be the affordable price (under $30 USD) of the product
        </span>
        <span>
          The age range of potential users are 18-25 years old young female who enjoys sports, makeup and online shopping
        </span>
        <span>
          For potential users, the most appealing product feature is the cute animal outline that even fits in girls’ makeup bag
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>CAMPAIGN MATERIAL DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        Color is one of the most recognizable aspect of our product. The designer use warm and bright colors which correlate with the products to create an delightful brand identity and memorable visual impression for young female demographic. The visual style we defined also differentiated our product from other competitors on the market.
      </p>

      <h4>Commercial Photography</h4>
      <p>
        We mapped out two sets of commercial photography that aligned to our user profile:<br>
        1. Contextualize the product<br>
        We gave the product characteristic with storytelling by putting the animals in their living environments to emphasize the adorable product outline<br>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani5-2.jpg" src="" alt="">
        2. “What’s in my bag” image series<br>
        Since each animal corresponds to a specific type of female consumers, we put the product together with different types of accessories that are commonly found in a girl’s purse to resonate with users. The pictures also give users a better sense about who is likely to use the product and which style to choose from<br>
         <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani7-1.jpg" src="" alt="">
      </p>
      <h4>Motion Graphic Design</h4>
      <p>
        Based on previous experiences, videos are one of the most widespread crowdfunding campaign methods. We created a motion graphic with coherent colors which is consistent with the brand design guideline, and also made a strong visual impression on viewers.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Animal-3.png" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        The animator set the living environment of each animal as a metaphor for body parts. The adorable illustrations elaborated the fact that enjoying solo sex is natural. So goes the product’s saying, “Girls also have the right to love themselves accompanied by the cute animals.”

      <h3>WEBSITE DESIGN</h3>
      <h4>One-Page Responsive Web Design</h4>
      <p>
        Our team proposed to create a one-page responsive webpage instead of using the crowdfunding platform template without a mobile version. We believed a well-designed webpage will better present the product feature and provide users an immersive browsing experience.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first ever crowdfunding campaign on the uDesign platform presented with one single landing page. The average site visit duration reached 8 minutes with over 48,000 visitors (average site visit duration in the e-commerce industry is 1.5 minutes.) The extraordinary sales results and positive feedback have proved that website design strongly affects how a product is perceived. 
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/Animal-4.png" src="" alt="">
      <h4>Visual Design</h4>
      <p>
        The web design also followed the brand identity and color guideline set previously to create a delightful, fresh and warm feeling instead of sexy. We also make sure to put each design element in the interface that has a corresponding user story.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          First screen:<br>
          We caught users’ attention with the carousel design of full-sized contextualized product images. The vivid visual impression will lead them to discover more information on the website
        </span>
        <span>
          Product introduction page: <br>
          Each animal had its own introduction webpage which users can click through the sticky navigation bar. The introduction pages creates a complete context and story along with the commercial photography, allowing users to understand the different style and features they care about
        </span>
        <span>
          Warning signs: <br>
          We redesigned the pop-up window with animation of the animals so users would be less resistant towards warning signs. The design has drastically lowered the bounce rate to 57% when users entered the website
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Content Strategy</h4>
      <p>
        Besides visual design, we also gave the product a lively image through copywriting. We carefully wrote in our users’ tone to reflect their needs and feelings, and hope that they would view Animal Savior in a comfortable, non-pornographic light. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The followings are the key points of our website content:
        <span>
          Emphasize the harmless appearance of small animals:<br>
          “Animal Savior” is a little gadget that makes you happy rather than an actual sex toy. It is equivalent to your makeup gadgets – its size fits easily into your purse
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani2.jpg" src="" alt="">
        <span>
          Provide answer to users’ hesitation - why would I need a sex toy?<br>
          “Just a gentle touch, which doesn’t have to be the touch of your lover – can make you feel loved and cared for,” breaking the stereotype that sex toys must always be sexy and steamy.
        </span>
        <span>
          Put the product into context with style suggestions:<br>
          We tailored a unique characteristic for each animal, allowing users to relate and choose the styles they like the most
        </span>
        <span>
        Certified material and secure experience:<br>
          The product used extremely soft, FDA approved medical silicone to provide a gentle vibration and pleasant non-invasive experience especially for first-time users.
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani5-1.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <h3>CAMPAIGN PROMOTION</h3>
      <h4>Organic Reach & Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        Based on our previous experience, ad-driven traffic were accounted for at least 50% of the total website traffic in the crowdfunding and e-commerce industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, sex toys are a sensitive product category. Facebook advertising is entirely banned, so we must rely on organic reach or try other approaches to keep our product exposed to the target users to reach the crowdfunding goal:
        <span>
          Organic traffic from animation video: since the motion graphic of Animal Savior is extremely impressive and well received, we accumulated more than 150 shares and 37,000 views on the very first day published on Facebook
        </span>
        <span>
          Google Adwords: We bought keywords including “Animal Savior” and “sex toys” with accurate ad copywriting to keep our ad ranking within top 3 
        </span>
        <span>
          YouTube ads: the motion graphic video has been disseminated out on YouTube at an extremely low cost. 26% of those who have watched more than 10 seconds of the video have been directed to our website (while an average click rate is approximately 5%-10%)
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani9.jpg" src="" alt="">
      </p>
      <h4>Social Media Engagement</h4>
      <p>
        Since relevant legal restrictions are rigid regarding such products, we chose to promote through the diffusivity of social networks:
        <span>
          Media partner corporation: <br>
          We cooperated with PopDaily, the largest online media site with 900,000 likes focusing on girls topic, to introduce the product with 3 Facebook posts and short videos. As a result, 18% of the sales number was brought in by their posts.
        </span>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani10.jpg" src="" alt="">
      </p>  
      <p>
        <span>
        Key opinion leaders: <br>
        We discovered from the research findings that most of our potential users are first-time sex toy buyers. Therefore, we invited 10+ makeup and fashion bloggers to share the product on social network, stressing the assuring and adorable characteristics of Animal Savior. This strategy has also successfully brought in conversions from 400+ potential consumers.
