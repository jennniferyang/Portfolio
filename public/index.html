      <h3>Design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them.</h3>
      <p>
       Born and raised in Taiwan, I am a current master student in Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) at University of Washington. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have developed a multidisciplinary skill set in design, management and social science, which helps me understand users’ unspoken need and analyze factors that influence their experience. Prier to HCDE, I  worked as a Project Manager for two years in the crowdfunding and e-commerce industry. My work experience allows me to always keep business value in mind while designing for users.
      </p>
       <p>
        I value empathy in crafting designs that speak to the audience. I am able to define problems, analyze factors that influence user experience, and drive impact by transforming ideas into reality.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        “Furever Pal” was a project developed in the course of User-Centered Design Interaction at University of Washington. The app allows users to find a adoptable pet they like, see how it would look in their homes and fit their lifestyles. It features AR (augmented reality) experience and Tinder-inspired swiping interaction to streamline the decision making process for users to choose the right pet.
      </p>
      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2017/09 - 2017/12
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        User Research<br>
        Usability Testing
        UX Design Iteration
      </p>
      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <h4>Problem Space</h4>
      <p>        
        Only 1 out of 10 animals in shelters is adopted while 2.7 million dogs and cats are put to sleep each year. The purpose of our project is to improve communication between animal shelters and those interested in pet ownership. However, we discovered that the scope of our goal was too broad and general, therefore we narrowed our scope to focus on the adoption process.
      </p>
      <h4>Original Design Question</h4>
      <p>
        "How might we help improve communication between animal shelters and potential pet owners, so that the adoption process goes more smoothly?"
      </p>
      <h4>Research Methods</h4>
      <p>
        We conducted quantitative and qualitative research methods among our target users to better understand the adoption process from both animal shelters’ perspectives and pet owners’ perspectives.
        <span>
          Survey: We designed a survey targeting current and potential pet owners and received 90 responses in a week
        </span>
        <span>
          Interview: We conducted interviews with three local animal shelters: Regional Animal Services of King County (RASKC), Emerald Pet City Rescue, and PAWS
        </span>
        <span>
          Contextual Inquiry: We conducted contextual inquiry at a pet adoption event hosted by Ginger’s Pet Rescue. We were able to witness both stakeholders’ sides - not only how employees and volunteers do their jobs, but also how potential adopters interact with the staff and pets
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Research Findings</h4>
      <p>
        From the interviews:
      </p>
      <p>
        From the survey results:
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on our research findings, we found that the adoption process is already easy and smooth here in Seattle; however, we were intrigued that many people found the decision making process to be the most difficult part of the entire adoption process. We decided to refine our design question to focus on that specific aspect, which is choosing the right pet. 
      </p>
      <h4>Refined Design Question</h4>
      <p>
        How might we help improve communication between animal shelters and potential pet owners, so that the decision making part of the adoption process is easier?
      </p>
      <h3>PERSONA</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Primary users: Potential pet adopters</b>
        We hope to introduce a solution for potential pet owners to discover and connect with pets that are best suited for their requirements and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Design Requirements</b>
        1. The solution should improve the discoverability of adoptable pets<br>
        2. The solution should help adopters find pets that are most suitable for them<br>
        3. The solution should make the decision process easier for adopters<br>
        4. The solution should provide an immersive experience helping potential adopters to emotionally connect with the pets<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Secondary users: Staffs, fosters, and volunteers of animal shelters</b>
          These people will use our solution to manage and maintain useful information of pets in their shelters. These pieces of information are necessary to help adopters choose the right pet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Design Requirements</b>
        1. The solution should provide a convenient mechanism for managing pet information<br>
        2. The solution should help produce better marketing content of adoptable pets<br>
        3. The solution should improve animal shelters’ reach to more potential pet adopters<br>
      </p>

      <h3>IDEATION</h3>
      <p>
        Our team conducted an ideation session and sketched 20+ ideas to meet our users’ needs based on our research findings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping the primary use case “finding the right pet” in mind, we critique and filter the sketches, then decided to combine two of the most promising ideas - Tinder-inspired pet finding app with augmented reality (AR) to streamline the decision process - to create our design solution prototype. This combination would create the strongest product to tackle our design question. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our design solution “Furever Pal” is an easy-to-use and intuitive app for users to efficiently find a pet they like and see how that pet would look in their homes and fit their lifestyles. 
      </p>
      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        Our designer chose to use warm colors and Sans serif fonts to create a light, refreshing and engaging app design. The app should also provide an effortless, intuitive and smooth user experience.
      </p>
      <h4>Constraints</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          It is hard to present immersive AR experience in the mockup and the prototype
        </span>
        <span>
          Low-fidelity prototypes or paper prototypes cannot highlight the efficiency of the swiping mechanism
        </span>
        Therefore, our team decided to build a high-fidelity mockup for prototyping with a creative way to showcase the AR feature for our product.
      </p>
      </p>
      <h3>PROTOTYPE</h3>
      <h4>How Our Prototype Supports The Design Requirements</h4>
      <p>
        We derived design requirements from our research findings: intuitive design that improves pet discoverability, help people find a suitable pet, provide an immersive experience, and help make the decision process easier. Users will be able to use our design mockup to complete the following use cases:<br>
        1. Find a pet by swiping left or right<br>
        2. Use AR to get a better sense of the pet<br>
        3. Reserve a meet & greet with the pet<br>
      </p>
      <h3>USABILITY TESTING</h3>
      <p>
        We conducted 5 usability testings and get feedbacks from on our key questions to improve our design solution. The folowing are the findings:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What Worked</b>
         <span>
           4/5 users thought our app makes finding an adoptable pet more efficient and make discoverability better
         </span>
         <span>
           4/5 users thought the survey questions helped choose and filter the most suitable pets
         </span>
         <span>
           All 5 users liked the AR feature
         </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What Didn't Work</b>
         <span>
           4/5 users accidentally swiped left on a pet and wished they could go back and learn more about the pet before deciding to pass or like. 
         </span>
         <span>
           4/5 users didn’t know that to learn more information about the pet they needed to swipe up. They tried to “tap” instead
         </span>
         <span>
           3/5 users suggested including more information on the meet and greet confirmation pop-up
         </span>
         <span>
           2/5 users were not tech-savvy and didn’t know the term “AR”
         </span>
      </p>
      <h3>ITERATION</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
        Improved the instruction overlay: simplified the text and updated the symbols
        </span>
        <span>
          “Go Back” functionality: add a button to allow users to go back to a pet they may have accidentally swiped left on  
        </span>
        <span>
          Rebranded AR Feature: change the text of the AR button for users to understand what this function does
        </span>
        <span>
          Confirmation Pop-Up: provide name of animal shelter in addition to the date and time of the appointment
        </span>
        <span>
          Enhanced pet information with multimedia content: add carousel design to allow users to discover more pictures and videos
        </span>
        <span>
          Survey design: add more choices to pet activity level
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>FUTURE DIRECTION</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
        As the first project in the HCDE master program, we went through a full research process during this project. We am are lucky to have have a cross-functional team consists with a clear division of work, and we gained different field knowledge and feedbacks from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also learned how to scope down our ideas into a complete solution since we started our project with huge ambitions and too broad of a goal. We could have a more specific focus for a more accurate research direction. Also, we would like to recruit real target users for usability testings to validate our design.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        “BookeMe” is a award-winning project created in cooperation with three developers and a designer in the 2017 Booking.com Taipai hackathon.<br>
        “BookMe” aims to simplify the decision making process by providing personalized travel recommendations with the best offers on Booking.com. The app applies image recognition technique to the content users interacted with on Instagram, and analyzes their preference to recommend travel spots accurately.

      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        User Research<br>
        Interaction Design
      </p>
      <h4>CONSTRAINTS</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          Our team must start the project with a blank slate
        </span>
        <span>
          With only 48 hours to finish the project and the final presentation, the time for user research, design iteration and preparing for final presentation is extreme limited
        </span>
      </p>

      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <h4>User Journey</h4>
      <p> 
        We aimed to understand the online travel booking experience starting from users’ first step of decision making within 2 hours. At the beginning, We created a user journey of a travel shopper to help us visualize the areas we needed to target for our research. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, we conducted 5 semi-structured interviews with people who have booked a trip online. Below are the main findings:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Users want to determine where they should go efficiently with all the offers when they are planning a trip
        </span>
        <span>
          Users want more personalized travel suggestions based on their preference instead of recommendations based on travel history on their Booking.com homepage
        </span>
        <span>
          Users tend to make travel decisions according to interaction on social network and friends’ suggestion (52% of users user social media to plan a trip)
        </span>
        <span>
          Users want to get notified when the best offers appears of their desirable travel spots
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p> 
        After analyzing and organizing all the information, the detailed user stories were formulated. The following are the main requirements of the app in the user stories: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, we conducted 5 semi-structured interviews with people who have booked a trip online. Below are the main findings:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          Users can log in with their social media account in the product
        </span>
        <span>
          Users can get personalized travel suggestions based on a more precise preference setting instead of existing filters
        </span>
        <span>
          Users’s interaction with their friends on social media can help them make travel decisions easier
        </span>
        <span>
          Users can get notified when the best offers appears of their desirable travel spots
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to build an app “Bookme” that reverse the way users used to plan a trip. A user tends to decide where to travel based on friends’ recommendation on trip planner websites, but the biggest problem is that the results aren’t personalized. Therefore, we start the first step from analyzing user preferences more accurately to recommend places and best offers for a better planning experience.
      </p>
      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <h4>Interaction Design</h4>
      <p>
        Based on the users stories, I first made the flowchart and then the wireframes to communicate and confirm the flow and the key features of the app.
      </p>
      <h4>Visual Design</h4>
      <p>
        The design intends to create a delightful feeling for travel shoppers to experience the new flow of planning a trip. The interaction should be smooth and effortless because it's suppose to lubricate the current booking process.
      </p>
      <h4>Development</h4>
      <p>
        We decided to apply image recognition techniques to the Instagram content users interacted with and analyze them with Google Cloud Platform API. The comprehensive results can analyze users’ preference more accurately and predictively for recommendations, and can optimize through machine learning.
      </p>
      
      <h3>PROTOTYPE</h3>
      <p>
        The engineers hand-coded a digital prototype in 5 hours to showcase our ideas and communicate the transition and interaction in the app. 
      </p>
      <h3>FINAL IMPLEMENTATION</h3>

      <p>
        Booking.com aims to provide hotels, homes and everything in between. If Booking.com exceeds your expectation at the moment you open the room door, Bookme find the exact expectation for you!
      </p>
      <h3>FUTURE DIRECTION</h3>
      <p>
      Our team are positive about more business development about “Bookme”:
      <span>
        For B2C : we want to link more current users and invite potential users from Boking.com
      </span>
      <span>
        For B2B:  the recommendation results and user preference data can help related travel industries to understand user needs and create more accurate ads

      <p>
        The engineers and product managers from Booking.com found our idea and prototype to be highly valuable. We received comments that this application addressed a well-known problem and used image recognition techniques appropriately to solve the problem, even from business perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hackathon was a challenging and insightful two-day training. I have gained hands-on experience about the collaboration process of development within a limited time, and how to make rapid progress in a small team.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        First launch in 2014, Backme is a payment application developed by Backer-Founder. By releasing customized APIs to easily embed into a website, users can create a crowdfunding campaign or an e-commerce website without the limitation of a crowdfunding platform. Project creators can also manage their campaign, user data, and transaction records on the admin panel. Backme has assisted over 700 projects to go online, with a total cash flow of $100 million USD and 300,000+ transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the product manager, I conducted user research and usability testings to propose usability insights and new feature recommendations. I also coordinated with UI designers and developers to redesign the admin panel.
      </p>
      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2016/02-2017-08      
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        Product Manager     
      </p>
      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted 5 interviews and contextual inquiries with three types of users: project creators (external), project managers (internal) and developers. Contextual inquiries complement the interview answers, and helped me define users’ need when I observe their behavior using Backme.
      </p>
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          For clients, they want a clear visual hierarchy to help them find necessary informations to deal with customer service on the admin panel
        </span>
        <span>
          For project managers, they want to have access to real-time sales data from different sources (ideally visualized), so that they can calculate conversion rate to adjust marketing strategies
        </span>
        <span>
          For developers and designers, the application lacks a systematic design guideline, which makes it hard to develop and iterate efficiently
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back1.jpg" src="" alt="">

      <h4>Define Problems</h4>
            <p>
        <span>
          Clients cannot find necessary project information because the navigation and visual hierarchy lack simplicity and clarity. Furthermore, the search bar was nor presented unless users scroll to the right
        </span>
        <span>
          Project managers need to spend a lot of time dealing with customer services and explaining how to use the product for project creators
        </span>
        <span>
          Project managers want to see the real-time conversion data in a clear form like other analytical tools, so they can adjust marketing strategies more efficiently
        </span>
        <span>
          Project managers can hardly categorize information from mutual projects without a tag / label system in the database
        </span>
        <span>
          Finally, project managers point out that the high bounce rate (83%) at the check out page should be optimized
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back2.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back3.jpg" src="" alt="">

      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the users stories, I prioritized the tasks and created wireframes with the designer together to communicate the features. As the product manager, I invited all the stakeholders to monthly meetings to reach agreement on key features and the design decision.
      </p>
      <h3>Task 1: Redesign the Project Dashboard</h3>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back4.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        We redesigned the project dashboard to refine the navigation and visual hierarchy of the original project dashboard and provide project information more efficiently.
      </p>

      <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
      <p>
       We held a meeting with all the stakeholders involved to reorganized the information architecture of the Project Dashboard to ensure users can easily discover all the necessary project information they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       We decided to design two versions that users can switch between:<br>
      <span>
        Grid view: implements card style design with a more responsive display for different screen sizes. It present project image with brief introduction, sales and backer number
      </span>
      <span>
        List view: displays more projects in a limited space. It presents only the project name, sales number and backer number
      </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also added tags and labels as part of the project information, so users can categorized similar projects. We carefully regulate the operating behavior of each card, eliminating distracting elements so that the users can easily find the key gadgets.
      </p>

      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>
       The designer and I created wireframes to conceptualize the ideas and communicate with developers. Also, I present wireframes to project managers to ensure the space allocation and prioritization of content meet their needs.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 2: Redesign the Data Analysis Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
       One of the important tasks for project managers is to keep track of conversion rate to optimize marketing strategies. Originally, they analyze website traffic and conversions by comparing the user data on Google Analytics with the sales number on Backme to calculate conversion rate manually. 
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Backme actually keeps track of the Google UTM parameters code for individual link. Therefore, our goal is to redesign the data display on the Data Analysis Dashboard, which helps project managers evaluate real-time conversion rate efficiently. 
      </p>
      <p>
       To present a clear interface of data analysis, we visualized the main indicators of user behaviors. The designer created an intuitive UI that condensed huge amounts of data into charts, which can also display real-time data responsively when users hover.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also created the “ROAS calculator” feature (Return On Advertising Spend) by importing Google Analytics tracking data to Backme. Users can input the cost for each advertising campaign to calculate the conversion rate automatically.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back5.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back6.jpg" src="" alt="">

      <h3>Task 3: Optimize the Checkout Process</h3>
      <p>
       As an embedded online payment tool, the user goals of our product are:<br>
       1. For clients, they want to ensure the conversion rate at checkout - the last step of the online shopping process <br>
       2. For end users (customers), they want to buy products online with a easy to understand, simple, and secure checkout experience <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      Before optimizing, Backme has a 83% bounce rate in the check out process. We redesigned several key points to optimize users’ payment experience as simple and intuitive as possible. One month after the design is implemented, we successfully reduced bounce rate by 30% and increased conversion rates between 15-20%.
      </p>

      <h4>Chunking Checkout Steps</h4>
      <p>
       We improved the design by chunking the checkout process into 3 steps so users feel simple and easy. The 3 step design is suggested by a payment study conducted by Shopify. By grouping relevant information together in chunks, and putting it in a logical order, Backme allow users to focus on one task at a time.
      </p>
      <span>
        Confirm Order → Shipping Information → Payment
      </span>

      <h4>Web Form Filling Experience</h4>
      <p>
       Filling the form is considered the final step to complete checkout. Users should be able to complete forms quickly and without confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aim to make our users feel that registration is a value-added benefit, even though it is mandatory. Therefore, Backme only request necessary information and asks to create an account in order to track the order progress at the order confirmation stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The followings are some tips of redesigning our web form filling experience: 
      <span>
        Only ask for required information because every extra field will affect its conversion rate
      </span>
      <span>
        Order the form logically from the user’s perspective, and group related fields together
      </span>
      <span>
        Use drop down menu for a list of options (e.g. Country Lists)
      </span>
      <span>
        Provide visual feedback on correct information and adaptive error message when users enter information incorrectly
      </span>

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
       I have participated in the product development on both stakeholder’s side - as the product manager and the user (project manager) - for almost two years. We ran sprints internally with different beta version then released for our clients in the crowdfunding and e-commerce industry. We used these feedbacks to identify key functionalities, prioritize tasks and keep refining the design for better user experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have gained practical experience on how to make rapid progress in a cross-functional team, and keep iterating the product design and strategy through repetitive testing, user data and customer validation.

      <h2>Animal Savior</h2>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani1.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        Animal Savior is a <a href="https://red-dot.de/pd/online-exhibition/work/?lang=en&code=16-01578-2017&y=2017&c=227&a=0" target="_blank">2017 Red Dot Award</a> winner in Product Design, and also the first ever crowdfunding project of sex toy in Taiwan. It is known for its groundbreaking animal outlines, delicate texture as well as intuitive control. My team at Backer-Founder assisted with the overall marketing strategies and campaign page design, achieving the funding target of $80,000 USD with 1,546 supporters in 45 days, which was 350% of the expected target. 
      </p>
      <h3>Campaign Production</h3>
      <h4>Copywriting</h4>
      <p>        
        (1) The harmless appearance of small animals:
        <span>
          Animal Savior is a little gadget that makes you happy rather than an actual sex toy. It is equivalent to your makeup gadgets – its size fits easily into your purse.
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani2.jpg" src="" alt="">
        (2) Why would I need a sex toy?
        <span>
          “Just a gentle touch, which doesn’t have to be the touch of your lover – can make you feel loved and cared for,” breaking the stereotype that sex toys must always be sexy and steamy.
        </span>
        (3) Certified material and vibration:
        <span>
          Extremely soft medical silicone is used, providing a gentle vibration and pleasant experience.
        </span>
        <br>
        Before the pre-order launched, users had been discussing which kind of animal they wished to buy, so we have tailored a unique characteristic for each animal, along with suggestions of what kind of personalities each best fit.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani5-1.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <h5>
        The information presented on the first screen of our website, allowing users to relate and choose the styles they like the most.
      </h5>
      <h4>Motion Graphic Design</h4>
      <p>
        Based on previous experiences, videos are one of the most widespread crowdfunding campaign methods. We therefore opted to create motion graphic from the very start - with colorful and coherent colors that made a strong visual impression on viewers.
        The lives of each small animal are a metaphor for body parts.<br>The adorable illustrations elaborate the fact that enjoying solo sex is something natural. So goes the product’s saying, “Girls also have the right to love themselves.”

          </div> 
        </div> 
      </p>
      <h4>Commercial Photography</h4>
      <p>
        To create the overall visual tone of the product, we mapped out two sets of commercial photography:
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani5-2.jpg" src="" alt="">
        (1) Product scenario: surrounding small animals and living environments, warm colors were used to create impressive and memorable visual styles.
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani7-1.jpg" src="" alt="">
        (2) Accessories: each animal corresponds to a specific type of female consumers, put together with various accessories that are commonly found in a girl’s purse, thus resonating with consumers. 
      </p>
      <h4>Landing Page Design</h4>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani4.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        It is our hope to use a one-page web design landing page to present a complete product scenario. This is the first ever crowdsourcing produce on uDesign being presented with one single landing page. The extraordinary outcome has proved that web presentation strongly affects how a product is perceived. 
      </p>
      <h4>Website Planning</h4>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani8.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        <span>
          Warning signs: according to the local laws, those under age 18 are not allowed to enter the website or purchase sex toys. However, we were hoping that people would view Animal Savior in a different, non-pornographic light. We therefore redesigned the pop-up window according to the current style of the website, where users would be less resistant towards warning signs. This has drastically lowered the bounce rate.
        </span>
        <span>
          First screen: We attracted users with full-sized product scenario photography, which successfully led them to our website for more information.
        </span>
        <span>
          Page break: each animal had their own unique page break. This creates a specified scenario and complete background story along with the commercial photography.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>After The Project Is Launched</h3>
      <h4>Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        Sex toys are a sensitive product category. Facebook advertising is entirely banned, so we tried other means in order to keep our product exposed to the target audiences:
        <span>
          Google Adwords Advertising: We bought keywords such as “Animal Savior” and “sex toys”, keeping our advertisement rank within top 3. This attracted users on to our website as they were searching for related products. 
        </span>
        <span>
          Organic traffic from videos: since the motion graphic of Animal Savior is extremely impressive and well received, we accumulated more than 150 shares and 37,000 views on the very first day it was published. 
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani9.jpg" src="" alt="">
        <span>
          YouTube ads: motion graphics has been disseminated out on YouTube at an extremely low cost. 26% of those who have watched more than 10 seconds of the video have been guided to our website to understand more about the product (while an average click rate is approximately 5%-10%). 
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Social Media Promotion</h4>
      <p>
        Since relevant legal restrictions are rigid regarding such products, we chose to promote via the diffusivity of social networks:
        <span>
          Media Cooperative Guidance: we teamed up with PopDaily, an online media site aimed at girls. PopDaily has written a blog entry to introduce Animal Savior according to their target audiences.  
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani10.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <h5>
        The blog style fits what the target audiences prefer. Therefore two blog posts have brought us 10% of the total funds. 
      </h5>
      <p>
        <span>
          Blogger Samples: Since we targeted users who are first-time sex toy buyers, we cooperated with makeup and fashion bloggers, stressing the assuring and adorable characteristics of Animal Savior. This has also successfully brought in conversions from potential consumers.
