      <h3>Design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them.</h3>
      <p>
        I have a great passion for observing and understanding user’s unspoken needs and thoughts, analyzing factors that influence user experience, and providing useful and feasible recommendations to refine a design. I am also active in completing projects with quality and efficiency, and translating ideas into realizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them. I have developed a multi-disciplinary skill set in management, design and social science, and I am looking forward to obtain the mindset and skills needed for becoming a user researcher, one who believes in human-centered design with all her heart and aspires to make a real difference in users’ lives.

      <h3>Professional Work Experience</h3>
      <h4>
        Project Planner, Consulting Department, Backer-Founder
      </h4>
      <p>
        As a Project Planner, I have actively engaged in over 7 crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter and domestic, raising over $12 million USD in the past year. I observe consumer insights and keep track of advertising and sales data closely to optimize marketing strategies for crowdfunding campaigns. From sufficient hands-on project experiences, I realized that user experience is the most critical driving force to facilitate conversions in marketing campaigns. In my portfolio, I listed 2 crowdfunding projects and a payment product I engaged in to demonstrate my experience in the user experience design field.

      <p>
        Animal Savior is the first ever crowd-sourcing sex toy in Taiwan. Known for its ground-breaking animal façade as well as its delicate, soft texture, it came in second in “crowd sourcing” categoty of the udn Design Award in 2016. Backer-Founder assisted with the overall marketing planning for Animal Savior, achieving the one million target within 42 hours. It won 1546 supporters over 44 days, which is 350% of the target fund!<br><br><br>


        Early Phase<br><br>


        - Strategy Setting: More than 70% of the sex toy market has been possessed by males. However, the characteristics of “Animal Savior” gives a sense of cuteness, safe, trustworthy as well as being affordable all the while. These portraits allows us to set its target audience as females who are buying sex toys for the very first time. This concept was applied to the style of crowdfunding page design, video and promotion in order to attract and communicate with potential customers.<br><br>

        Campaign Production <br><br><br>


        - Copywriting<br>
          Through copywriting, we have given the product a vivid image. 
          (1) The harmless appearance of small animals: <br>
          Animal Savior is a little gadget that makes you happy rather than an actual sex toy. It is equivalent to your makeup gadgets - fits in your purse!
          (2) Why would I need a sex toy? <br>
          “Just a gentle touch, which doesn’t have to be the touch of your lover - makes you feel loved and cared.” Consumers would break the impression of sex toys being sexy and steamy.<br>
          (3) Certified material and vibration: <br>
          Extremely soft medical silicone is used, providing a gentle vibration and experience.<br><br>


          Before the preorders start, people has been deliberately discussing which animal they wish to buy. So we have tailored an unique characteristic for each animal, along with suggestions of what kind of personalities would they fit in. <br><br>


        - Motion Graphic Design<br>
          Based on previous experiences, videos are the most wide-spread crowd funding campaign. We have chosen to create motion graphic from the very beginning - with colorful and coherent hues that leaves a strong visual impression. <br><br>


          The lives of small animal is a metaphor for body parts. The adorable illustrations elaborates the fact that this is something natural, “girls also have the right to love themselves”. <br><br>


        - Commercial Photography<br>
          In order to create the overall visual tone of the product, we have mapped out two sets of commercial photography:<br>
          (1) Product Scenario: Surrounding small animals and living environments, warm colors are used in order to create impressive visual styles. <br>
          (2) Accessories: Each animal corresponds to a specific type of girl, which has been put together with various accessories that appears in a girl’s purse - thus resonating with the consumer. <br><br>

            
        - Web Planning<br><br>
          
          - Warning Signs: According to law, those under 18 years of age is not allowed to enter this site or purchase any sex toys. However, we were hoping that people would take sex toys in a rather polite manner. We redesigned the pop-up window according to the current style of the website, where users would be less resistant towards warning signs. This has drastically lowered the bounce rate.<br>
          - First screen: We attracted users with full-sized product scenario photography, which successfully leads them to our website for more information.<br>
          - Page Break: Each animal has their own unique page break. This creates a specified scenario and complete background story along with the commercial photography. <br>
          <br>
          After the project is on line<br><br>

        - Advertising<br>
          Sex toys are a sensitive product category. Facebook advertising is entirely banned. Therefore, we attempted other means in order to keep our product exposed to the target audiences:<br>
          - Google Adwords Advertising: We have bought keywords such as “Animal Savior”, “sex toys”, keeping our advertisement rank within top 3. This lures user on to our website as they are searching for related products. <br>
          - Organic Traffic from Videos: Since the Motion Graphic of Animal Savior is extremely impressive, we have gotten more than 700 shares and 20,000 views on the very first day it was published. <br>
          - YouTube adds: Motion Graphic has been spread out on YouTube at an extremely low cost. 26% of those who have watched more than 10 seconds of the video has been guided to our website to understand more about the product (while an average click rate is approximately 5%-10%). <br><br>


        - Social Media Promotion<br>
          Since the restrictions are quite rigid, we chose to promote via the diffusivity of social networks:<br>
          - Media Cooperative Guidance: We teamed up with PopDaily, which was an  online media built for girls. PopDaily has written a blog to introduce Animal Savior according to their target audiences. <br>
          [PHOTO]: The blog style fits what the target audiences likes, therefore two blog posts has brought us 10% of the total funds. <br>
          - Blogger Samples: We target users who are “first time sex toy buyers”. The emphasis wasn’t put on bloggers who are specialized in blogging about sex toys. Instead, we have contacted makeup bloggers and fashion bloggers, stressing the assuring and adorable characteristics of “Animal Savior”. This has successfully brought in conversions from potential consumers. <br><br>

      <h4>Email Marketing</h4>
