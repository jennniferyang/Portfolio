      <h3>Design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them.</h3>
      <p>
        I have a great passion for observing and understanding user’s unspoken needs and thoughts, analyzing factors that influence user experience, and providing useful and feasible recommendations to refine a design. I am also active in completing projects with quality and efficiency, and translating ideas into realizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them. I have developed a multi-disciplinary skill set in management, design and social science, and I am looking forward to obtain the mindset and skills needed for becoming a user researcher, one who believes in human-centered design with all her heart and aspires to make a real difference in users’ lives.

        <h3>bookworm</h3>
        <p>
          A shop where books are bought and sold is a bookshop or bookstore. Books can also be borrowed from libraries. Google has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 distinct titles had been published.[1] In some wealthier nations, printed books are giving way to the usage of electronic or e-books,[2] though sales of e-books declined in the first half of 2015.

        <h3>For other uses, see Book</h3>
        <p>
          A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.

        <h3>Antiquity</h3>
        <p>
          When writing systems were created in ancient civilizations, a variety of objects, such as stone, clay, tree bark, metal sheets, might be used for writing. The study of such inscriptions forms a major part of history. The study of inscriptions is known as epigraphy. Alphabetic writing emerged in Egypt. The Ancient Egyptians would often write on papyrus.
