      <h3>Design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them.</h3>
      <p>
       Born and raised in Taiwan, I am a current master student in Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) at University of Washington. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have developed a multidisciplinary skill set in design, management and social science, which helps me understand users’ unspoken need and analyze factors that influence their experience. Prier to HCDE, I  worked as a Project Manager for two years in the crowdfunding and e-commerce industry. My work experience allows me to always keep business value in mind while designing for users.
      </p>
       <p>
        I value empathy in crafting designs that speak to the audience. I am able to define problems, analyze factors that influence user experience, and drive impact by transforming ideas into reality.

      <h2>Furever Pal</h2>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani1.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <h3>Early Phase</h3>
      <h4>Strategy setting</h4>
      <p>
        Male consumers accounted for more than 70% of the sex toy market in Taiwan. However, the characteristics of “Animal Savior” gave a sense of cuteness, safety, trustworthiness as well as real affordability, which allowed us to set its target audience as females who were buying sex toys for the first time. This concept was applied to the style of crowdfunding page design, video and promotion in order to connect with first-time female buyers.
      </p>
      <h3>Campaign Production</h3>
      <h4>Copywriting</h4>
      <p>        
        (1) The harmless appearance of small animals:
        <span>
          Animal Savior is a little gadget that makes you happy rather than an actual sex toy. It is equivalent to your makeup gadgets – its size fits easily into your purse.
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani2.jpg" src="" alt="">
        (2) Why would I need a sex toy?
        <span>
          “Just a gentle touch, which doesn’t have to be the touch of your lover – can make you feel loved and cared for,” breaking the stereotype that sex toys must always be sexy and steamy.
        </span>
        (3) Certified material and vibration:
        <span>
          Extremely soft medical silicone is used, providing a gentle vibration and pleasant experience.
        </span>
        <br>
        Before the pre-order launched, users had been discussing which kind of animal they wished to buy, so we have tailored a unique characteristic for each animal, along with suggestions of what kind of personalities each best fit.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani5-1.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <h5>
        The information presented on the first screen of our website, allowing users to relate and choose the styles they like the most.
      </h5>
      <h4>Motion Graphic Design</h4>
      <p>
        Based on previous experiences, videos are one of the most widespread crowdfunding campaign methods. We therefore opted to create motion graphic from the very start - with colorful and coherent colors that made a strong visual impression on viewers.
        The lives of each small animal are a metaphor for body parts.<br>The adorable illustrations elaborate the fact that enjoying solo sex is something natural. So goes the product’s saying, “Girls also have the right to love themselves.”

          </div> 
        </div> 
      </p>
      <h4>Commercial Photography</h4>
      <p>
        To create the overall visual tone of the product, we mapped out two sets of commercial photography:
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani5-2.jpg" src="" alt="">
        (1) Product scenario: surrounding small animals and living environments, warm colors were used to create impressive and memorable visual styles.
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani7-1.jpg" src="" alt="">
        (2) Accessories: each animal corresponds to a specific type of female consumers, put together with various accessories that are commonly found in a girl’s purse, thus resonating with consumers. 
      </p>
      <h4>Landing Page Design</h4>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani4.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        It is our hope to use a one-page web design landing page to present a complete product scenario. This is the first ever crowdsourcing produce on uDesign being presented with one single landing page. The extraordinary outcome has proved that web presentation strongly affects how a product is perceived. 
      </p>
      <h4>Website Planning</h4>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani8.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        <span>
          Warning signs: according to the local laws, those under age 18 are not allowed to enter the website or purchase sex toys. However, we were hoping that people would view Animal Savior in a different, non-pornographic light. We therefore redesigned the pop-up window according to the current style of the website, where users would be less resistant towards warning signs. This has drastically lowered the bounce rate.
        </span>
        <span>
          First screen: We attracted users with full-sized product scenario photography, which successfully led them to our website for more information.
        </span>
        <span>
          Page break: each animal had their own unique page break. This creates a specified scenario and complete background story along with the commercial photography.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>After The Project Is Launched</h3>
      <h4>Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        Sex toys are a sensitive product category. Facebook advertising is entirely banned, so we tried other means in order to keep our product exposed to the target audiences:
        <span>
          Google Adwords Advertising: We bought keywords such as “Animal Savior” and “sex toys”, keeping our advertisement rank within top 3. This attracted users on to our website as they were searching for related products. 
        </span>
        <span>
          Organic traffic from videos: since the motion graphic of Animal Savior is extremely impressive and well received, we accumulated more than 150 shares and 37,000 views on the very first day it was published. 
        </span>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani9.jpg" src="" alt="">
        <span>
          YouTube ads: motion graphics has been disseminated out on YouTube at an extremely low cost. 26% of those who have watched more than 10 seconds of the video have been guided to our website to understand more about the product (while an average click rate is approximately 5%-10%). 
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Social Media Promotion</h4>
      <p>
        Since relevant legal restrictions are rigid regarding such products, we chose to promote via the diffusivity of social networks:
        <span>
          Media Cooperative Guidance: we teamed up with PopDaily, an online media site aimed at girls. PopDaily has written a blog entry to introduce Animal Savior according to their target audiences.  
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/ani10.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <h5>
        The blog style fits what the target audiences prefer. Therefore two blog posts have brought us 10% of the total funds. 
      </h5>
      <p>
        <span>
          Blogger Samples: Since we targeted users who are first-time sex toy buyers, we cooperated with makeup and fashion bloggers, stressing the assuring and adorable characteristics of Animal Savior. This has also successfully brought in conversions from potential consumers.

Its update version, Ticwatch S & E is powered by Android Wear™ and has raised over 3 million USD on Kickstarter with 19,251 backers, ranked as the 2nd best smartwatch product (after Pebble). My team at Backer-Founder was responsible for the Ticwatch series Taiwan pre-order campaign. We analyzed user insights through research to develop holistic marketing and design strategies, and pushed the sales number over 1 million USD. It is ranked as the most funded crowdfunding/pre-order project in Taiwan in 2017.

      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2016/12 - 2017/08
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        Project Manager
      </p>

      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <p> 
        At the begining, we involved the client in the brainstorming session to understand users' background and needs in the US and China market. We discovered that users in different countries tend to have distinct preferences on features and style in terms of wearable products. Therefore, we decided to conduct a quantitive research to clarify the user profile of the Taiwan market.
      </p>
      <h4>Survey</h4>
      <p>
        We designed three types of surveys by targeting three different potential user groups with Facebook ads: <br>
        1. Users who are interested in wearable devices<br>
        2. Users who are familiar with other smartwatch brands<br>
        3. Tech-savvy users and early adopters<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to make sure that users will be provided with specifically customized content in tune with their respective interests and expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than 5,000+ survey responses (including e-mail lists) were collected within a month, which helped us identify the most compelling features and buying incentives to our target users, define a clearer potential user profile, and further scope the design focus of our website and advertising.
      </p>

      <h3> CAMPAIGN MATERIAL PRODUCTION </h3>

      <h4> Commercial Photography </h4>
      <p>
        Product images are a powerful way to capture the user’s attention and to differentiate a product. Besides the photos provided by our client, we re-photographed commercial photos for Ticwatch focusing on the product itself and the most commonly used functions catering to user’s needs from our research. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Below is how we communicate with the designer to ensure our product imagery allow users to experience the product on a digital website:<br>
      <span>
        Contextualize the product images: put the product into context to help users clarify exactly what the product is, how it is used, and who is likely to use it
      </span>
      <span>
        Find the perfect zoom: make use of the zoom functionality for the user to see relevant product details
      </span>
      <span>
        Multiple images: we took product photos in multiple angles to show all the important features so that users can better visualize its details 
      </span>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/tic2.jpg" src="" alt="">

      <h4> Promotion Video </h4>
      <p>
        We edited the original video into a short version with transcript and animation to mark the product highlights, and help user understand what Ticwatch does in everyday life. We also produced an testing video so users can get a better sense of the product. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The two promotion video reached 345,000 and 410,000 views respectively on Facebook, and successfully turn into conversion for 25% of total sales.
      </p>
      
      <h3> WEBSITE DESIGN </h3>
      <b>Ticwatch Taiwan Official Website: 
          <a href="http://www.ticwatch2.com.tw/" target="_blank">www.ticwatch2.com.tw</a>
        </b>
        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/tic4.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p> 
        To build the pre-order website with localized design and customized content based on our user research, we discard copying the style from the global website and Kickstarter page. However, we still implement consistent branding across all channels so that users recognize the brand and the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        I coordinated with designers and developers to create a engaging digital experience for the website. It also has a responsive design that adapts to look perfect on all of the different devices.
      </p>
      <h4> Information Architecture & Content Strategy </h4>
      <p>
        We aim to design a website with a clear information architecture and hierarchy which allow users to discover the information they expect easily. We come up with the main sections of the website:<br>
        1. List the achievements on Kickstarter and media quotes for brand awareness and enhance users’ confidence toward crowdfunding products<br>
        2. Demonstrate product highlights with interactive design<br>
        3. Contextualize the product, allowing users to understand the features they care about<br>
        4. Provide product specification to ensure users have all the detailed information before purchase<br>
        5. Improve site description and SEO with accurate keywords in HTML meta tags for users to search<br>

        <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/tic5.jpg" src="" alt="">
      </p>

      <h4> Visual Hierarchy </h4>
      <p>
        The website has been designed with different color sections that creates a neat hierarchy of content and helps users to navigate through the page with a nice rhythm. The sticky navigation also helps to drive traffic to the shopping cart with a call-to-action button visible at all time.
      </p>

      <h4> Animation </h4>
      <p>
        We incorporate animation as a functional element to enhance user experience. For example, To create an intuitive, user-friendly checkout process, we provide visual feedback on user action in the shopping cart, which helps inform users about the result of their operation. 
      </p>

      <h3>CAMPAIGN PROMOTION</h3>
      <h4>Email Marketing</h4>
      <p>
        Before launching the pre-order campaign, we sent 3 e-mail newsletters to potentials users to reveal the product information, and increase engagement by providing exclusive offers. 
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/tic3.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        We applied several UX design tips that impact directly on email marketing conversions:
      </p>
      <span>
        Responsive design: a well-developed design makes the emails readable on any screen
      </span>
      <span>
        Use logos and company own domain: it helps users recognize our brand
      </span>
      <span>
        Objective, relevant and personalized subject line: we keep short and clear titles that show relevance without forgetting the personal treatment
      </span>
      <span>
        Catchy header to transmit the message at the first glance: we make an impact with visual materials that can turn our email marketing more attractive so the reading flows
      </span>
      <span>
        Bullet points that turn the text into concise content
      </span>
      <span>
        Clearly marked and well placed Call-to-Actions
      </span>
      <span>
        Sharing the content in social networks to engage
      </span>
      <p>
        The average email open rate reached over 45% with over 5,000 recipients (average email open rate of in the e-commerce industry of technology products: 5-10%), proved that we provided engaging content and targeted the accurate potential users.
      </p>

      <h4>Media Promotion</h4>
      <p>
        We were clear that the target users for press release are the editors and journalists. Therefore, our goal was to provide appealing media kits with catchy titles, exclusive images and press value to catch their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created the press release material with 3 major topics as listed below. As a result, Ticwatch was successfully featured on 20 mainstream medias, including including <a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/kickstarter-%E5%8F%B2%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%86%E8%B3%87%E9%87%91%E9%A1%8D%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E9%AB%98-ticwatch-2%E6%99%BA%E6%85%A7%E6%89%8B%E9%8C%B67%E8%99%9F%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E9%A0%90%E8%B3%BC-045400203.html" target="_blank">Yahoo! 3C</a> and <a href="http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20161207/1006094/" target="_blank"> Apple Daily</a> (the largest online media in Taiwan.)

      </p>

      <h4>Press Conference</h4>
      <p>
        We held a press conference on the first day of the Ticwatch pre-order campaign. We invited over 50 media editors and key opinion leaders in the technology field to experience the product debut, give us first-hand feedback on the experience, and spread the words on social network to increase media exposure, enhancing consumers’ confidence about the product quality.
      </p>
      <h5>

      <h4>Social Media Engagement</h4>
      <p>
        The target users of media promotion are journalists. Therefore our goal was to create attractive news points to increase their press value.<br>
        Our press releases focused on three major topics in our press kit as listed below, and successfully attracted over twenty mainstream media reports, including <a href="http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20161207/1006094/" target="_blank">Apple Daily</a> (the largest online media in Taiwan) and <a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/kickstarter-%E5%8F%B2%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%86%E8%B3%87%E9%87%91%E9%A1%8D%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E9%AB%98-ticwatch-2%E6%99%BA%E6%85%A7%E6%89%8B%E9%8C%B67%E8%99%9F%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E9%A0%90%E8%B3%BC-045400203.html" target="_blank">Yahoo! 3C</a>.

      <h4>Press Conference</h4>
      <p>
        To enhance exposure, we also held a press conference on the first day of the pre-order campaign, providing journalists with sufficient news materials including product demos and the introduction of the development team, meanwhile boosting consumers’ confidence. 
      </p>
      <h5>
        We invited the development team of Ticwatch 2 on the press conference to unveil the “Taiwan Limited Edition” first time in public.

      <h4>
        Social Media Promotion
      </h4>
      <p>
        Since our research findings showed that about 20% of our target users are still skeptical towards crowdfunding products (especially high-end technology products), we believed that reliable user reviews and opinion leadership played a informally influential role in consumers’ attitude and purchase decision. 
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/tic6.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        Therefore, we invited the top 20 domestic technology key opinion leaders to try out Ticwatch, and share their professional experience along with product details on Facebook, blogs and forums. We also communicated with the development team based on the first-hand feedback of these early-adopters to adjust and optimize the operating system of Ticwatch.
      </p>
      <p>
        We found that 20% of the sales number was brought in by the these reviews on social media (70% was from advertising, 10% from media reports, and the rest from native searches). This proved that reliable user reviews are trust-worthy for users to make their buying decision.
      </p>
      <h4>Facebook Advertising</h4>
      <p> 
        Over 80% of our website traffic was driven by Facebook ads. 5% amount of the total sales numbers were spent on advertising, and the ad conversions was accounted for 70% of the total sales. 
       </p>
       <p> 
        We continued to monitor real-time ad performance since the data directly reflects users’ preferences and behaviors. We conducted A / B testing with different product images and ad copywriting for the same set of audiences, in order to evaluate the best-performing ad and understand how to speak to our audience effectively.  
       </p>
       <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/tic7.jpg" src="" alt="">
       <h5>
         By evaluating CPC (Cost per Click) and CTR (Click Through Rate), we learned whether the ads were appealing enough for users to click the call-to-action<br>
       </h5>
       <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/tic8.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        The conversion rate is the main performance indicator required by our client. We calculated the conversion rate through the Google UTM tracking parameter attached to every ad link. On the first week of the pre-order campaign, the ad conversion rate reached an amazing 1: 130; the data remained steadily at 1:20 or even higher two months later, proving that we were effectively tailoring to the accurate audience segments and providing engaging content.

      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
        First launch in 2014, Backme is a payment application developed by Backer-Founder. By releasing customized APIs to easily embed into a website, users can create a crowdfunding campaign or an e-commerce website without the limitation of a crowdfunding platform. Project creators can also manage their campaign, user data, and transaction records on the admin panel. Backme has assisted over 700 projects to go online, with a total cash flow of $100 million USD and 300,000+ transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the product planner, I conducted user research and usability testings to propose usability insights and new feature recommendations. I also coordinated with UI designers and developers to redesign the admin panel.
      </p>
      <h4>TIME</h4>
      <p>
        2016/02-2017-08      
      </p>
      <h4>ROLE</h4>
      <p>
        Product Planner      
      </p>
      <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>
        I conducted 5 interviews and contextual inquiries with three types of users: project creators (external), project managers (internal) and developers. Contextual inquiries complement the interview answers, and helped me define users’ need when I observe their behavior using Backme.
      </p>
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p>
        <span>
          For clients, they want a clear visual hierarchy to help them find necessary informations to deal with customer service on the admin panel
        </span>
        <span>
          For project managers, they want to have access to real-time sales data from different sources (ideally visualized), so that they can calculate conversion rate to adjust marketing strategies
        </span>
        <span>
          For developers and designers, the application lacks a systematic design guideline, which makes it hard to develop and iterate efficiently
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back1.jpg" src="" alt="">

      <h4>Define Problems</h4>
            <p>
        <span>
          Clients cannot find necessary project information because the navigation and visual hierarchy lack simplicity and clarity. Furthermore, the search bar was nor presented unless users scroll to the right
        </span>
        <span>
          Project managers need to spend a lot of time dealing with customer services and explaining how to use the product for project creators
        </span>
        <span>
          Project managers want to see the real-time conversion data in a clear form like other analytical tools, so they can adjust marketing strategies more efficiently
        </span>
        <span>
          Project managers can hardly categorize information from mutual projects without a tag / label system in the database
        </span>
        <span>
          Finally, project managers point out that the high bounce rate (83%) at the check out page should be optimized
        </span>
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back2.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back3.jpg" src="" alt="">

      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the users stories, I prioritized the tasks and created wireframes with the designer together to communicate the features. As the product planner, I invited all the stakeholders to monthly meetings to reach agreement on key features and the design decision.
      </p>
      <h3>Task 1: Redesign the Project Dashboard</h3>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back4.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <p>
        We redesigned the project dashboard to refine the navigation and visual hierarchy of the original project dashboard and provide project information more efficiently.
      </p>

      <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
      <p>
       We held a meeting with all the stakeholders involved to reorganized the information architecture of the Project Dashboard to ensure users can easily discover all the necessary project information they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       We decided to design two versions that users can switch between:<br>
      <span>
        Grid view: implements card style design with a more responsive display for different screen sizes. It present project image with brief introduction, sales and backer number
      </span>
      <span>
        List view: displays more projects in a limited space. It presents only the project name, sales number and backer number
      </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also added tags and labels as part of the project information, so users can categorized similar projects. We carefully regulate the operating behavior of each card, eliminating distracting elements so that the users can easily find the key gadgets.
      </p>

      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>
       The designer and I created wireframes to conceptualize the ideas and communicate with developers. Also, I present wireframes to project managers to ensure the space allocation and prioritization of content meet their needs.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 2: Redesign the Data Analysis Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
       One of the important tasks for project managers is to keep track of conversion rate to optimize marketing strategies. Originally, they analyze website traffic and conversions by comparing the user data on Google Analytics with the sales number on Backme to calculate conversion rate manually. 
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Backme actually keeps track of the Google UTM parameters code for individual link. Therefore, our goal is to redesign the data display on the Data Analysis Dashboard, which helps project managers evaluate real-time conversion rate efficiently. 
      </p>
      <p>
       To present a clear interface of data analysis, we visualized the main indicators of user behaviors. The designer created an intuitive UI that condensed huge amounts of data into charts, which can also display real-time data responsively when users hover.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also created the “ROAS calculator” feature (Return On Advertising Spend) by importing Google Analytics tracking data to Backme. Users can input the cost for each advertising campaign to calculate the conversion rate automatically.
      </p>
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back5.jpg" src="" alt="">
      <img data-src="/assets/img/main/works/back6.jpg" src="" alt="">

      <h3>Task 3: Optimize the Checkout Process</h3>
      <p>
       As an embedded online payment tool, the user goals of our product are:<br>
       1. For clients, they want to ensure the conversion rate at checkout - the last step of the online shopping process <br>
       2. For end users (customers), they want to buy products online with a easy to understand, simple, and secure checkout experience <br>
      </p>
      <p>
      Before optimizing, Backme has a 83% bounce rate in the check out process. We redesigned several key points to optimize users’ payment experience as simple and intuitive as possible. One month after the design is implemented, we successfully reduced bounce rate by 30% and increased conversion rates between 15-20%.
      </p>

      <h4>Chunking Checkout Steps</h4>
      <p>
       We improved the design by chunking the checkout process into 3 steps so users feel simple and easy. The 3 step design is suggested by a payment study conducted by Shopify. By grouping relevant information together in chunks, and putting it in a logical order, Backme allow users to focus on one task at a time.
      </p>
      <span>
        Confirm Order → Shipping Information → Payment
      </span>

      <h4>Web Form Filling Experience</h4>
      <p>
       Filling the form is considered the final step to complete checkout. Users should be able to complete forms quickly and without confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aim to make our users feel that registration is a value-added benefit, even though it is mandatory. Therefore, Backme only request necessary information and asks to create an account in order to track the order progress at the order confirmation stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The followings are some tips of redesigning our web form filling experience: 
      <span>
        Only ask for required information because every extra field will affect its conversion rate
      </span>
      <span>
        Order the form logically from the user’s perspective, and group related fields together
      </span>
      <span>
        Use drop down menu for a list of options (e.g. Country Lists)
      </span>
      <span>
        Provide visual feedback on correct information and adaptive error message when users enter information incorrectly
      </span>

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <p>
       I have participated in the product development on both stakeholder’s side - as the product planner and the user (project manager) - for almost two years. We ran sprints internally with different beta version then released for our clients in the crowdfunding and e-commerce industry. We used these feedbacks to identify key functionalities, prioritize tasks and keep refining the design for better user experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have gained practical experience on how to make rapid progress in a cross-functional team, and keep iterating the product design and strategy through repetitive testing, user data and customer validation.
