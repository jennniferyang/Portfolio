      <h3>Design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them.</h3>
      <p>
        I have a great passion for observing and understanding user’s unspoken needs and thoughts, analyzing factors that influence user experience, and providing useful and feasible recommendations to refine a design. I am also active in completing projects with quality and efficiency, and translating ideas into realizations.

      <p>
        To me, design is not about solving problems only, but also discovering them. I have developed a multi-disciplinary skill set in management, design and social science, and I am looking forward to obtain the mindset and skills needed for becoming a user researcher, one who believes in human-centered design with all her heart and aspires to make a real difference in users’ lives.

      <h3>Professional Work Experience</h3>
      <h4>
        Project Planner, Consulting Department, Backer-Founder
      </h4>
      <p>
        As a Project Planner, I have actively engaged in over 7 crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter and domestic, raising over $12 million USD in the past year. I observe consumer insights and keep track of advertising and sales data closely to optimize marketing strategies for crowdfunding campaigns. From sufficient hands-on project experiences, I realized that user experience is the most critical driving force to facilitate conversions in marketing campaigns. In my portfolio, I listed 2 crowdfunding projects and a payment product I engaged in to demonstrate my experience in the user experience design field.

      <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Early Phase</h3>
      <h4>Strategy setting</h4>
      <p>
        Male consumers accounted for more than 70% of the sex toy market in Taiwan. However, the characteristics of “Animal Savior” gave a sense of cuteness, safety, trustworthiness as well as real affordability, which allowed us to set its target audience as females who were buying sex toys for the first time. This concept was applied to the style of crowdfunding page design, video and promotion in order to connect with first-time female buyers.
      </p>
      <h3>Campaign Production</h3>
      <h4>Copywriting</h4>
      <p>        
        (1) The harmless appearance of small animals:
        <span>
          Animal Savior is a little gadget that makes you happy rather than an actual sex toy. It is equivalent to your makeup gadgets – its size fits easily into your purse.
        </span>
        <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
        (2) Why would I need a sex toy?
        <span>
          “Just a gentle touch, which doesn’t have to be the touch of your lover – can make you feel loved and cared for,” breaking the stereotype that sex toys must always be sexy and steamy.
        </span>
        (3) Certified material and vibration:
        <span>
          Extremely soft medical silicone is used, providing a gentle vibration and pleasant experience.
        </span>
        <br>
        Before the pre-order launched, users had been discussing which kind of animal they wished to buy, so we have tailored a unique characteristic for each animal, along with suggestions of what kind of personalities each best fit.
      </p>
      <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
      <h5>
        The information presented on the first screen of our website, allowing users to relate and choose the styles they like the most.
      </h5>
      <h4>Motion Graphic Design</h4>
      <p>
        Based on previous experiences, videos are one of the most widespread crowdfunding campaign methods. We therefore opted to create motion graphic from the very start - with colorful and coherent colors that made a strong visual impression on viewers.
        The lives of each small animal are a metaphor for body parts.<br>The adorable illustrations elaborate the fact that enjoying solo sex is something natural. So goes the product’s saying, “Girls also have the right to love themselves.”

          </div> 
        </div> 
      </p>
      <h4>Commercial Photography</h4>
      <p>
        To create the overall visual tone of the product, we mapped out two sets of commercial photography:
        <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
        (1) Product scenario: surrounding small animals and living environments, warm colors were used to create impressive and memorable visual styles.
        <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
        (2) Accessories: each animal corresponds to a specific type of female consumers, put together with various accessories that are commonly found in a girl’s purse, thus resonating with consumers. 
      </p>
      <h4>Landing Page Design</h4>
      <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        It is our hope to use a one-page web design landing page to present a complete product scenario. This is the first ever crowdsourcing produce on uDesign being presented with one single landing page. The extraordinary outcome has proved that web presentation strongly affects how a product is perceived. 
      </p>
      <h4>Website Planning</h4>
      <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        <span>
          Warning signs: according to the local laws, those under age 18 are not allowed to enter the website or purchase sex toys. However, we were hoping that people would view Animal Savior in a different, non-pornographic light. We therefore redesigned the pop-up window according to the current style of the website, where users would be less resistant towards warning signs. This has drastically lowered the bounce rate.
        </span>
        <span>
          First screen: We attracted users with full-sized product scenario photography, which successfully led them to our website for more information.
        </span>
        <span>
          Page break: each animal had their own unique page break. This creates a specified scenario and complete background story along with the commercial photography.
        </span>
      </p>
      <h3>After The Project Is Launched</h3>
      <h4>Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        Sex toys are a sensitive product category. Facebook advertising is entirely banned, so we tried other means in order to keep our product exposed to the target audiences:
        <span>
          Google Adwords Advertising: We bought keywords such as “Animal Savior” and “sex toys”, keeping our advertisement rank within top 3. This attracted users on to our website as they were searching for related products. 
        </span>
        <span>
          Organic traffic from videos: since the motion graphic of Animal Savior is extremely impressive and well received, we accumulated more than 150 shares and 37,000 views on the very first day it was published. 
        </span>
        <span>
          YouTube ads: motion graphics has been disseminated out on YouTube at an extremely low cost. 26% of those who have watched more than 10 seconds of the video have been guided to our website to understand more about the product (while an average click rate is approximately 5%-10%). 
        </span>
      </p>
      <h4>Social Media Promotion</h4>
      <p>
        Since relevant legal restrictions are rigid regarding such products, we chose to promote via the diffusivity of social networks:
        <span>
          Media Cooperative Guidance: we teamed up with PopDaily, an online media site aimed at girls. PopDaily has written a blog entry to introduce Animal Savior according to their target audiences.  
        </span>
      </p>
      <img src="http://img.udn.com/art/udesign/event/201607/animal_savior/images/index/banner/banner_03.jpg" alt="">
      <h5>
        The blog style fits what the target audiences prefer. Therefore two blog posts have brought us 10% of the total funds. 
      </h5>
      <p>
        <span>
          Blogger Samples: Since we targeted users who are first-time sex toy buyers, we cooperated with makeup and fashion bloggers, stressing the assuring and adorable characteristics of Animal Savior. This has also successfully brought in conversions from potential consumers. 
        </span>

      <h3>Early Phase</h3>
      <h4>Pretotyping / Fake Door Market testing</h4>
      <p>
        We designed three different types of questionnaires by targeting three different audience groups: (1) people interested in wearable devices, (2) people interested in other smartwatch brands, and (3) tech-savvy consumers, to identify a clearer potential consumer profile.
      </p>
      <img src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/948/285/14afdc5494fef6a8a042c3bd39fb7cfd_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1472123214&auto=format&q=92&s=4b56b7a03bbac9a43d329b4552fcb239" alt="">
      <h5>
        More than 4,000 responses were collected within a month, which helped us identify the most compelling features of and buying incentives to consumers, and to further clarity the focus of our website and advertising.
      </h5>
      <h4>Email Marketing</h4>
      <p>
        Before launching the pre-order campaign, we sent preferential information via e-mail to potentials users to drive customer loyalty by providing exclusive offers.
      </p>
      <img src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/948/285/14afdc5494fef6a8a042c3bd39fb7cfd_original.jpg?w=1536&h=864&fit=fill&bg=000000&v=1472123214&auto=format&q=92&s=4b56b7a03bbac9a43d329b4552fcb239" alt="">

        By targeting accurate potential consumers, the average email open rate reached over 45% (average email open rate of other technology products: 15-25%).

      <h3>After The Project Is Launched</h3>
      <h4>Media Promotion</h4>
      <p>
        The target users of media promotion are journalists. Therefore our goal was to create attractive news points to increase their press value.<br>
        Our press releases focused on three major topics in our press kit as listed below, and successfully attracted over twenty mainstream media reports, including <a href="http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/new/20161207/1006094/" target="_blank">Apple Daily</a> (the largest online media in Taiwan) and <a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/kickstarter-%E5%8F%B2%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%86%E8%B3%87%E9%87%91%E9%A1%8D%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E9%AB%98-ticwatch-2%E6%99%BA%E6%85%A7%E6%89%8B%E9%8C%B67%E8%99%9F%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E9%A0%90%E8%B3%BC-045400203.html" target="_blank">Yahoo! 3C</a>.

      <h4>Press Conference</h4>
      <p>
        To enhance exposure, we also held a press conference on the first day of the pre-order campaign, providing journalists with sufficient news materials including product demos and the introduction of the development team, meanwhile boosting consumers’ confidence. 
      </p>

      <h4>
        Social Media Promotion
      </h4>
      <p>
        Since Taiwanese consumers are more skeptical towards crowdfunding products, especially high-priced products such as smartwatches, we believed abundant and reliable user reviews played a vital role in consumer’s purchase decision. Therefore we invited the top 20 domestic 3C bloggers to try out Ticwatch 2 and to share product details and experience on their social media pages. In addition, we also communicated with the development team based on the first-hand feedback of these early-adapters to adjust and optimize the operating system of “Taiwan Limited Edition”

        We found that 20% of Ticwatch 2's pre-order amount was brought in by the bloggers’ reviews (60% was from advertising, 10% from media reports, and the rest from native searches), proving that reliable user reviews are trust-worthy references for consumers and can drive conversion.
      </h5>
      <h4>Advertising</h4>
      <p> 
        Most of our advertising costs were spent on Facebook. 5% of the sales numbers were used for advertising, and the conversion brought by ads accounted for 60% of the total sales. We continued to monitor ad performance and used different images, emphasizing different functions to conduct A / B testing for the same set of audiences to understand users’ true preferences, and what the best-performing ad images were. We continued to optimize the ads based on these results.<br>
        We also calculated the conversion rate through the tracking code such as Google UTM. On the first week of the pre-order campaign, the conversion rate (ROI) of the ads reached an amazing 1: 130; the data remained steadily at 1:10 or even higher a month later, proving that we were effectively advertising to the accurate audience and providing correct and appealing content.

        I assisted planning and conducting contextual inquiry and usability testing from over 15+ users to understand their actual needs and goals, analyzed the quantitative data to propose usability insights, and collaborated with UI designers and engineers to refine the current UI design of Backme in internal beta-testing before it officially launches.

      <h4>Optimizing Checkout Process</h4>
      <p>
        As an embedded payment tool, the core goals for our clients and website users are bringing conversion and pledging a product with ease, efficiency, and security. Therefore, we optimized several key points of the checkout process to make it as simple and intuitive as possible.
        <span>
          Less Distraction, More Actions<br>
          We find it clear for the users if a product is added to the cart without the need to leave the current page.
        </span>
        <span>
          Simplified 3 Checkout Steps<br>
          Confirm Purchase Items → Fill in Shipping Information → Choose Payment
        </span>
        <span>
          Easy form filling<br>
          We aim to make sure our users feel that registration is a value-added benefit, even though it is mandatory, so Backme only collects all necessary data from the order checkout and asks to create a password in order to track the order progress at the order confirmation stage.

        Using asterisks for mandatory fields<br>
        Using drop downs where there are lists of options (e.g. Country Lists)<br>
        Using radio buttons when there are only a few options

      <h4>Redesign the Dashboard by Data Visualization</h4>

      <img src="/assets/img/main/work4.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        Backme keeps track of the Google UTM tracking code for each advertising link and displays the data with a dashboard, allowing users to directly evaluate the real-time performance and conversion rate of each ad.<br>
        To present a clear interface of data analysis, we visualized the four main indicators of user behaviors, including “Clicks of the Link ”, “Ranking of the Clicks”, “Devices Analysis” and “Browser Analysis" to create an intuitive UI. The chart can also responsively display real-time data when users hover.
      </p>
      <h4>Implement Card-style UI Into Project Lists</h4>
      <img src="/assets/img/main/work4.jpg" alt="">
      <img src="/assets/img/main/work4.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        We redesigned the traditional way of presenting all projects into two modes, allowing our users to switch between card styles and list UI. To specify, the card style design is clearer and easier for users to focus on, along with a more responsive display for different screen sizes. We also carefully regulate the operating behavior of each card, eliminating distracting elements so that the users can find the key operation gadget with ease.
